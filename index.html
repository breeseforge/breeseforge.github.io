Breese Forge is a custom bladesmith and blacksmith shop located in Upstate
New York, U.S.A.. A Breese Forge product is truly unique, with all
manufacturing, finishing, and packaging done by hand. No computer machining
is done on a Breese Forge knife, and even the forging is done entirely with
hand hammers- no presses or power hammers, which are present in most modern
smith's shops. It is common for a modern knife maker to simply grind out
blades, but Breese forge is able to create a superior blade by employing
nearly lost forging techniques, which are explained in further detail on
the about page of this website. We believe that complete and utter
dedication to a craft, as well as the desire to always improve, allows a
superior product to be made.

Blacksmithing is a craft dating to approximately 1000 B.C., which also
happens to be, in the opinions of some historians, around the time when man
began the transition from survival to true advancement in the fields of
science, literature, religion, and agriculture. This alignment is not
coincidental. The advent of iron tools, weapons, and commodities allowed
man to better partake in agriculture, defense from animals, and
architecture. The blacksmith in a village of this time period (up to the
1700s) manufactured every metal object used by the village- from nails to
swords to locks. Due to their importance, blacksmiths often held positions
of religious and political power. As modern manufacturing methods were
developed, however, the blacksmith and his tools became obsolete. During
and after the Industrial Revolution the craft of blacksmithing was almost
entirely lost, but it has recently undergone a resurgence.
