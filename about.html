            <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Wyatt Breese, and I am currently 15 years old and attending high school. My passion for forging steel was born in the August of 2015, when I was 13. For all those convinced that 2 years experience is not sufficient to develop, attached are pictures of my very first knife. You will know which it is. My passion for knives extends further into the past, to the day when I got my first knife: a small folding Remington pocket knife. I was 4 years old and I received the knife from my father for working on firewood with him. I immediately realized the fact that knives are the ultimate useful tool, and used mine all the time; carving spoons, cutting rope, and driving screws. I continued to enjoy knives up until I began making them, but never really became interested in the science and history involved in the production of them. Then one day in the Summer of 2013, I decided that I was going to build a small coffee can forge, just as a project for the day. What I didn’t know was that I would soon be hooked on making knives. As I continued making knives I have been able to improve my equipment to now include a larger forge and a 2x72 belt sander. I was (and still am) completely obsessed with the science of the process and I constantly seek new information to further the development of my knives. This fascination has led me to gain a college level knowledge of metallurgy, and to partake in many metallurgy related projects. I hope to study materials science in my higher education.</p>
<h2 id="about-my-knives">About My Knives</h2>
<p>My knives are all made entirely by hand; forged with 3 different hand hammers, and ground with a 2x72 belt sander. I have an antique Anvil from Mousehole Forge in Sheffield, England. My knives are able to perform better than those simply ground out because I employ the technique known as austenite forging. Austenite forging involves forging the bevels into a knife at a temperature lower than the critical temperature of the steel. Austenite in the steel is less stable at this low temperature, and when it is forged, the grain structure of the steel is reduced. This makes a better hardening steel, but takes much more work than the alternatives. Very few modern smiths employ this technique, and you will not buy another knife that has been austenite forged. Every knife that I make improves on the previous one, and I do my best to always learn from and act on my mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="about-ordering">About Ordering</h2>
<p>All items shown in the for sale sections are available for purchase. The items with “standard model” included in the knives are not pre-made. This means that when you order a standard model knife, you will have to specify your choice of handle material and other variables in your order note to me. You will pay half of the price of the knife as a deposit for materials and labor at the time of purchase, and the remaining payment once the knife is complete. These standard model items work the same way as custom orders, and will add to my backlog. You will receive progress updates.</p>
